        Using the Attributes we can tell Spring what to do
        class = location of the class
        Traditionally when you create object you create the reference as well right? for that "id" attribute is used

    <bean id = "sb" class = "services.SpringBoot"/>
    <bean id = "java" class = "services.Java"/>
    -->
    <!--
        For Setter Injection attribute is property tag
        ref = "java" why? because we are injecting java object
        name = "course" why? because we have created a setter in class TShapedSkill and the variable name is "course"
   -->
    <!-- Setter Injection
    <bean id = "ts" class = "services.TShapedSkills">
        <property ref = "java" name = "course"/>
    </bean>
    -->
    <!-- Constructor Injection
    <bean id = "ts" class = "services.TShapedSkills">
        <constructor-arg ref = "java" name = "course" />
    </bean>
    -->
    <!--
    Both Setter and Construction Injection are manual wiring which we have to do here

    So for we have Autowiring
    -->
<!-- <bean id = "ts" class = "services.TShapedSkills" autowire="byType"/> -->
    <!--
    When you do this, spring will ge confused, because as we have set autowire="byType"
    In both Setters and Constructor Injection ref = "java" or ref = "sb" are classes
    and name = "course" is the interface, so Spring is getting 2 types i.e. sb, java and getting confused which one to use
    You can solve this by giving using primary attribute
    <bean id = "sb" class = "services.SpringBoot" primary="true"/> it will take this and auto wire it
    <bean id = "java" class = "services.Java"/>
    -->
    <bean id = "sb" class = "services.SpringBoot"/>
    <bean id = "java" class = "services.Java"/>
    <bean id = "ts" class = "services.TShapedSkills">
        <property ref = "java" name = "course"/>
    </bean>

</beans>
