# 🌱 Welcome to the Spring Framework Repository!

Hello and welcome! 👋 This repository is a structured guide to understanding and implementing the **Spring Framework** and **Spring Boot**. This repository does not contains everything but it will get you started. Each section follows a progressive learning path, helping you transition from XML-based configurations to modern annotation-based and Spring Boot approaches. 🚀

## 📂 Project Structure

### 1️⃣ Why Spring Framework?
This section introduces the **Spring Framework**, explaining its necessity, advantages, and how it simplifies Java development. If you're new to Spring, start here! 🌱

### 2️⃣ SpringXMLApproach
This module demonstrates **Spring’s XML Configuration** approach. You'll learn how to define beans using XML files and manage dependencies in a structured way.

### 3️⃣ SpringXMLAnnotationApproach
Here, we enhance the **XML-based approach** by incorporating **annotations**. This hybrid model helps transition from XML-heavy configurations to a more declarative way of defining dependencies.

### 4️⃣ SpringAnnotationApproach
This module fully embraces **Spring's Annotation-Based Configuration**, eliminating XML and leveraging Spring Core annotations like `@Component`, `@Autowired`, and `@Configuration` to manage beans.

### 5️⃣ SpringBootApp1, SpringBootApp2, SpringBootApp3
Your first **Spring Boot application**! 🎉 This section introduces **Spring Boot**, showing how it simplifies configuration and dependency management while providing an embedded server.
